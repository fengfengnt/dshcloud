**dshcloud** provides isolated workspaces for [DeepSeek Harness](https://github.com/deepseek-ai/deepseek-harness) (`dsh`) on infrastructure you control, with centralized authentication, resource quotas and version management. Users can access their workspaces through a browser. Workspace data is persisted independently, so files, sessions, plugins and configuration remain intact across version upgrades.

After deploying the platform, administrators can add users through invitation links. Each user can create and manage multiple workspaces within their assigned quota.

> **Early development — run it on a test machine.** This is not production-ready: deployment validation and security work are still open. See the permission boundaries and operational limits in the [architecture and security model](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) before exposing it to the internet.
>
> **The installer changes the host it runs on**, and the platform keeps changing it afterwards — it writes a storage pool and an `/etc/fstab` entry, installs deployment assets under `/opt/dsh-cloud`, binds ports `80` and `443`, and runs containers with access to the Docker socket. Workspace data lives on the host filesystem, and workspace containers run with permission to modify it. Use a machine you are willing to rebuild.
>
> Interfaces, configuration and on-disk layout are still moving. Watch the repository for releases and read them before upgrading.

## Local dsh vs. dshcloud

| Running dsh locally | On dshcloud |
| --- | --- |
| Depends on the local device remaining available | Runs continuously on infrastructure you control |
| Access is limited by the local device | Accessible through a browser from multiple devices |
| No resource or data isolation between users | **Multi-user:** each user receives isolated workspaces |
| Multiple projects require separate installations | **Multiple workspaces:** each user can create several workspaces |
| Upgrades may require environment reconfiguration | Image-based upgrades preserve persistent data |

## Features

- **Workspaces:** create, start, stop, rebuild and delete workspaces. Each workspace has an independent container and persistent storage, with configurable limits for CPU, memory, process count and disk capacity.
- **Multi-user:** administrators add users through invitation links. Users can access and manage only their assigned workspaces.
- **Access control:** workspace ports are published only to the host loopback interface. External access requires Traefik authentication, an ownership check and per-workspace signature validation.
- **Version management:** synchronize the version catalog from GHCR, publish versions and configure the default version. Upgrades replace the image and create a rollback-capable data snapshot beforehand.
- **Console:** account status, resource quotas, usage sampling and workspace log streaming.
- **Interface:** English and Simplified Chinese, light and dark themes, ⌘K command menu.

## Getting Started

### Deploy to your own server

A Linux host with Docker (Compose v2), ports `80` / `443` free, and a disk that can enforce a quota.

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/eskim2001/dshcloud/main/scripts/install.sh | bash
```

<details>
<summary>More options</summary>

The full list is in the script's `--help`:

| Option | If omitted |
|---|---|
| `--version <tag>` | Uses `latest` (**which moves**; the digest actually pulled is recorded in `/opt/dsh-cloud/.installed-version`) |
| `--wizard-port <port>` | Tries `3000-3003` and takes the first free one |
| `--pool-root <path>` | `/var/lib/dsh` |
| `--pool-size-mb <MB>` | 80% of the free space on that filesystem |

The page takes the **parent** domain: the console lives at `console.<parent>` and every workspace takes a subdomain of its own. Certificates are issued per host, so the wildcard record `*.<parent>` must point at this machine first.

**Prerequisites**

- A Linux host (x86-64 or arm64) with Docker and Compose v2.
- **Storage that can enforce a hard quota**: `HOST_STORAGE_ROOT` (default `/var/lib/dsh`) must either sit on XFS mounted with `pquota`, or the script creates a loopback XFS image for it (needs root, and writes the mount into `fstab`). If neither is possible the install refuses to proceed. See [D18](docs/DECISIONS.md).
- Ports `80` and `443` free: the ingress binds them directly, and `80` is also needed for the ACME HTTP-01 check.
- Host access to GHCR (both the platform image and workspace images come from there).

**Upgrade** (keeps data and secrets):

```bash
curl -fsSL "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/eskim2001/dshcloud/main/scripts/install.sh" | bash -s -- update
```

**Uninstall** (keeps the database volume and storage pool; add `--purge` to delete data irrecoverably):

```bash
curl -fsSL "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/eskim2001/dshcloud/main/scripts/install.sh" | bash -s -- uninstall
```

</details>

**What the installer changes on your host**

- Creates the storage pool at `--pool-root` (default `/var/lib/dsh`). If that path is not already XFS mounted with `pquota`, it writes a loopback XFS image and adds a mount entry to `/etc/fstab`.
- Writes deployment assets and secrets to `/opt/dsh-cloud`.
- Starts the ingress, Postgres and the control plane as containers, binding ports `80` and `443` on the host.
- Every install/update configures platform-scoped INPUT/FORWARD rules and a systemd boot unit. Failure stops installation. Workspace access to host services, private networks and Docker bridges is blocked; outbound IPv6 is denied. Private model/Git endpoints will be affected. `--harden-host` remains a compatibility alias. Boot ordering and firewall reload protection still await completion and Linux verification; see [release gates](docs/PRODUCTION-READINESS.md).

The node agent holds the Docker socket and `CAP_SYS_ADMIN`, equivalent to host root. The control plane calls it through a local socket and retains broad instance-management authority. See [Deployment](docker/platform/README.md).

### Local development

Use this path when changing code. Prerequisites: Node.js 22+ and pnpm 10.10.0, plus Docker with Compose v2.

```bash
pnpm install
```

```bash
pnpm dev
```

## Contributing

Bug reports, documentation improvements and narrowly scoped pull requests are welcome. Include reproduction steps and environment details when reporting a bug. For changes to authentication, isolation or the data model, discuss the design and security implications before implementation.

See [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) for the local development workflow and repository conventions. Keep tests next to the behavior they cover and run the workspace checks before submitting changes. Update both README translations when changing shared documentation. After modifying the console UI, run `node scripts/readme-shots.mjs` to regenerate screenshots and keep them consistent with the current interface.
